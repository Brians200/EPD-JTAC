You are the Joint Terminal Attack Controller. It is your job to provide support to your team in the form of close air and artillery support. Make sure you bring a laser designator and batteries so you can call in support with the JTAC menu. Information about each attack capability is included in your diary. <br/><br/>
The location the guns will aim at is the average location of your laser pointer while it is acquiring a target, so be sure to hold the laser as close to the target as possible the entire time! <br/><br/>
Once the target location has been acquired, you will be notified that the rounds are inbound. It is safe to turn off your laser and run for cover at this point. <br/><br/>
After each attack, the guns will need time to reload. The time it takes to reload will depend on the size of the ammunition fired. <br/><br/>
The guns are shared between all JTAC operators and if another JTAC operator fires, you will have to wait for the guns to reload before you can fire. The more damage an attack does, the longer it will take for the target to be locked in. Be smart about what you are firing and when.
